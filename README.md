# install-deepstream-jetson

checkup.sh - checks whether the jetpack is properly installed or not, will show missing dependencies on terminal if not.
fix-jetpack.sh - this resolves the problem by removing some of my selected/aggregated packages and then reinstalling it again.
setup.sh - this installs some of the dependencies of python and DS-6.0 in Jetson

Thanks,
