# install-deepstream-jetson

checkup.sh - checks whether the jetpack is properly installed or not, will show missing dependencies on terminal if not. <br />
<br />
fix-jetpack.sh - this resolves the problem by removing some of my selected/aggregated packages and then reinstalling it again.<br />
<br />
setup.sh - this installs some of the dependencies of python and DS-6.0 in Jetson
<br />

Thanks,
